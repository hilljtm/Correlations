<p>January, 2019 looks like both charts bottomed out and had a nice recovery, but without further investigating we can't
    assume a correlation. Let's break down the math and go from there. </p>
<img id="faangmath" , src="/static/faangmath.png" alt="faangmath">
<p>Luckily in programming they do these hard math problems relatively simple for us.</p>

<div class="faang">
    <h1>FAANG</h1>
    <p> FAANG which is a catchy acronym for Facebook($FB), Apple($AAPL), Amazon($AMZN), Netflix($NFLX), Google($GOOG).
        It is the five most popular and best perfoming tech stocks. The market capitilziation of these comapnies was
        equal to $3.1 trillion. </p>
    <p>They are known as growth and momentum stocks, and are the most highly valued in the world from a p/e perspective.
        They trade on Nasdaq, which is included in the S&P500 index, which as we've covered before is a broad
        representation of the market. They make up 1% of the index. An increase or decrease in these stocks directly
        influences the index.</p>
    <p>Were going to take a look at possible correlations, with these companies being known as tech stocks, and bitcoin
        being known as disruptive technology maybe there is a correlation.</p>
