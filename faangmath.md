Calculating the covariance: 
(x, y) = ?(xn - x?)(yn - ?)/N-1

Calculating the mean:
x = ( Î£ xi ) / n 

FAANG Result: 
$ 1991.77 $

BTC Result:
$ 4225.25 $

Subtracting mean from sum: 
$ 1991.77 $ - $4225.25 $
gives us a negative value of $ -2233.48 $

Then we must multiply the answer by number of rows we have for variable x, which has 1211 non-null rows.
for y we have 847 non-null rows. 

x1 = $ -2233.48 * 1211(x) = 2704744.28, do the same for faang(y)

y1= 
Note: p values can only be between -1 and 1, the closer p value to 0 the greater the variance between given variables, vice versa.
